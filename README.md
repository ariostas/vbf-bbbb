Here you can find all my code used for the vbf-bbbb analysis.

The main files are the ones called vbf-bbbb_X.C, all of which run over the vbf-bbbb and background samples. All of these perform the analysis in a different way.

vbf-bbbb_0.C: selects 4 bjets and 2 light jets.

vbf-bbbb_1.C: selects 3 bjets and 3 light jets.

vbf-bbbb_2.C: selects 2 bjets and 4 light jets.

vbf-bbbb_3.C: selects 1 bjets and 5 light jets.

vbf-bbbb_4.C: selects 0 bjets and 6 light jets.

To run use root vbf-bbbb_X.C+\(\"name of background sample\"\)

Here you can find all my code used for the vbf-bbbb analysis.

The main file is the one named vbf-bbbb.C, which runs over the samples given as a parameter. It runs over the small ntuples saved in /afs/cern.ch/work/a/ariostas/public/vbf-bbbb/ . The small ntuples were created with the code found on the Selection folder.

To run use root vbf-bbbb.C+ to run over all samples or vbf-bbbb.C+(\"name of background sample\") to use a specific background sample.
